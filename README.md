# YIN

Yin is a rudimentary, experimental knowledge base. It is inspired by [Scone](https://github.com/sfahlman/scone), but is not meant to be a replacement/clone of Scone and its functionality.

## Functionality

Functionality is basically non-existent at the moment. Please do not use this library.
